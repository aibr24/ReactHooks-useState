# State

**What is a State?**:
* The state contains data that may change over time. So this is perfect for variables that might be changed frequently.

**What is so special about State?**:
- Changes in state trigger a re-render in react, so if we are rendering data to the user that might be subject to change,
state would be the man for the job.
