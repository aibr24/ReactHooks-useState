# State

**What is a State?**:
* The state contains data that may change over time. So this is perfect for variables that might be changed frequently.

**What is so special about State?**:
- Changes in state trigger a re-render in react, so if we are rendering data to the user that might be subject to change,
state would be the man for the job. Instead of having to reload the webpage and send a new request, we can harness the power
of react and re-render the page applying the changes.
